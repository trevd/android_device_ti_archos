Archos - A101S 

This is a device tree for Archos G9 Tablets. 

Building JellyBean:
Use the Android Sources located at http://omapzoom.org as a base 


Branch names
------------
As much as is reasonable i think mirror the branch names of the omapzoom.org branch
we intend to build against is useful.


buildspec.mk
------------
To Avoid those precious extra seconds require by lunch you can use make of the buildspec.mk
to provide predefined build info. either copy to the root of the android sources
or symlink - The Google buildsystem documentation say the buildspec.mk should never be
committed. I think that's bollocks.

Kernel
------
prebuilt kernel can be found in boot/zImage.
git clone -b linux-ics-3.0.21 http://gitorious.org/archos/archos-gpl-gen9-kernel-ics

PowerVR OpenGLES Drivers
------------------------
Sources for PowerVR Kernel Modules are located at device/ti/proprietary-open/omap4/sgx_src
some patching of ION structs in ion.h kernel headers maybe required.

The omaplfb kernel module needs building ; after unpacking the sgx tarball, the sources
can be found at proprietary-open/omap4/sgx_src/eurasia_km/services4/3rdparty/dc_omapfb3_linux/
No instructions seem to exist but it is an out of tree kernel module.

The post_build directory
------------------------
While testing and refining the device bringup etc many files get changed from the originals
the post_build directory reflects the current state of the device. When it is empty the build process
should make an image which can be pushed to the device without any issue
