Archos - A101S 

This is a device tree for Archos G9 Tablets. 

Building JellyBean:
Use the Android Sources located at http://omapzoom.org as a base 


Branch names
------------
As much as is reasonable i think mirror the branch names of the omapzoom.org branch
we intend to build against is useful.


buildspec.mk
------------
To Avoid those precious extra seconds require by lunch you can use make of the buildspec.mk
to provide predefined build info. either copy to the root of the android sources
or symlink - The Google buildsystem documentation say the buildspec.mk should never be
committed. I think that's bollocks.

Kernel
------
prebuilt kernel can be found in boot/zImage.
git clone -b linux-ics-3.0.21 http://gitorious.org/archos/archos-gpl-gen9-kernel-ics

PowerVR OpenGLES Drivers
------------------------
Sources for PowerVR Kernel Modules are located at device/ti/proprietary-open/omap4/sgx_src
some patching of ION structs in ion.h kernel headers maybe required.

init.rc
-------
The init.rc is designed to handle both recovery and normal booting.
persist.sys.bootmode recovery or persist.sys.bootmode android
